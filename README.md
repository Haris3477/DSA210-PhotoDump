# PhotoDump: Snapchat Activity Analysis

## Description
PhotoDump is a data science project focused on analyzing my Snapchat usage patterns, particularly around streaks. By examining historical data from Snapchat, this project aims to identify the average times of the day I typically send Snaps, receive Snaps, and open the app. This analysis will provide meaningful insights into my Snapchat habits over the past few years.

## Motivation
Social media platforms like Snapchat play a significant role in daily interactions. This project is motivated by the curiosity to better understand my own Snapchat behavior and streak activity. By analyzing when I am most active on the app, I hope to uncover patterns and trends in my usage habits.

## Tools to Be Used
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries (tentative):  
  - Pandas: For data cleaning and manipulation  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations  
  - NumPy: For numerical analysis  
  - Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and presenting the analysis  

## Data Source
The dataset for this project will be requested directly from Snapchat. The data will likely include timestamps for sent, received, and opened Snaps. After preprocessing, it will be used to extract meaningful patterns and trends.

## Data Processing
1. Raw Data: The raw data from Snapchat will contain details about my activity, such as sent and received Snaps.
2. Preprocessing: The data will be cleaned and structured for analysis. This may include:  
   - Converting timestamps into readable formats  
   - Extracting key activity patterns (e.g., sent/received/opened times)  
   - Removing unnecessary fields for streamlined analysis  

## Data Visualizations
- Time-Based Activity**: Visualize average times of day for sending, receiving, and opening Snaps over the past three years.  
- Daily and Weekly Trends**: Highlight which days and times I am most active on Snapchat.  
- Heatmaps: Create a heatmap to show activity density by time and day.

## Goals
- Determine the **average times of the day** I send and receive Snaps.  
- Identify the **average times of the day** I open Snapchat.  
- Visualize usage patterns through interactive and static charts.

## Limitations
- **Personal Data**: Since the project uses personal Snapchat data, careful attention will be paid to privacy and sensitive information.  
- **Data Scope**: The analysis is limited to the data provided by Snapchat, which may not include additional activity context.

## Findings (To Be Added Later)
The findings will include detailed insights into my Snapchat habits, such as the times I am most active and patterns over different days and years.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include other data points from Snapchat, if available.  
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict future Snapchat usage patterns based on historical data.  
- Explore connections between Snapchat usage and external factors like events or schedules.
